**Introduction**

This code demonstrates the concept of inheritance and polymorphism in PHP. We define a base class called `Fruit` with properties `name` and `color`, and a method `intro()` that introduces the fruit. We then define a child class called `Strawberry` that extends the `Fruit` class and adds a new property `weight`. The `Strawberry` class also overrides the `intro()` method to provide a more specific introduction for strawberries.

**Code Explanation**

1. **Base Class: Fruit**

```php
class Fruit
{
    protected $name;
    public $color;

    public function __construct($name, $color)
    {
        $this->name = $name;
        $this->color = $color;
    }

    public function intro()
    {
        echo "This fruit is {$this->name} and its color is {$this->color}";
    }
}
```

- The `Fruit` class defines two properties: `name` and `color`.
- The constructor method initializes these properties when a new `Fruit` object is created.
- The `intro()` method introduces the fruit by displaying its name and color.

2. **Child Class: Strawberry**

```php
class Strawberry extends Fruit
{

    public $weight;

    const LEAVE_MESSAGE = "Thank you for visiting our site"

    public function __construct($name, $color, $weight)
    {
        $this->weight = $weight;
        $this->name = $name;
        $this->color = $color;
    }

    public function intro()
    {
        echo "This fruit is {$this->name}, its color is {$this->color} and its weight is {$this->weight}";
    }

    public function message()
    {

        $this->intro();
    }

    public function addition($num1, $num2)
    {
        echo $num1 + $num2;
    }
}
```

- The `Strawberry` class extends the `Fruit` class, inheriting its properties and methods.
- The `Strawberry` class adds a new property `weight`.
- The `Strawberry` class overrides the `intro()` method to provide a more specific introduction for strawberries.
- The `Strawberry` class defines a constant `
